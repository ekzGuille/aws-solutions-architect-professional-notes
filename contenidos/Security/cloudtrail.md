* History of Events/API Calls made in the Account by:
  * Console
  * SDK
  * CLI
  * AWS Services
* Logs can be PUT in **CloudWatch** or **S3** (if you want to store them for more than **90 days**)

## CloudTrail Events
### Management Events
* By default **yes** logged
* Operations performed on resources in your Account
* **Read** Events and **Write** Events

### Data Events

### CloudTrail Insights Events
* If enabled -> Pay for it
* Detects **unusual** activity in the account
  * Example: *Hitting service limits*
